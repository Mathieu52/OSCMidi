# OSCMidi

OSCMidi enables the connection of any MIDI-enabled piano to a piano avatar in VRChat. OSCMidi is designed with virtual pianists in mind, featuring a section to note, mark, and search for songs, allowing you to quickly generate a random song you should know or simply check if you know a specific song in the first place.

-----------------------------------

### Notes

- The avatars DO NOT MAKE AUDIO, the audio has to come from your mic or through a DAW (Digital Audio Workspace) like FL Studio, Reaper, etc
- Supports both Mac OS and Windows (As VRChat doesn't currently support Mac OS, contact me and I'll be happy to provide you with a compatible copy of the software) 

-----------------------------------
